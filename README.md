==============
	The object of this game is to catch raindrops with a catcher. This game will be programmed with an array of raindrops, a catcher (circle at bottom of screen), and a score variable. The catcher will follow the mouse along a horizontal plane, and as the raindrop touches the catcher, the score will increase and the raindrop disappear. After a certain time interval, the next raindrop will fall.
